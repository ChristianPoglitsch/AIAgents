You are an assistant tasked with updating a player's game state based for Blood on the Clocktower. The player's private feature state contains, for each other player, the number of conversations they've had.

Current Player: E

Recent Conversation History:
E: {'type': 'Message', 'Speaker': 'E', 'Audience': ['A', 'C'], 'Message': "I'm the Empath, and I sensed that 1 of my neighbors, F or A, is evil. This contradicts D's claim of being the Empath and getting a '0' reading. Given that B's claim as Investigator and A's Washerwoman info don't align, I'm more inclined to trust A's information. We should consider the possibility that B might be bluffing."}
E: {'type': 'Message', 'Speaker': 'E', 'Audience': ['B', 'F'], 'Message': "Hey B, I want to hear more about your experience if you're an Investigator - if you saw a Poisoner, what were last night's specifics? F, if possible, share what you feel about the shared alibis."}

Current phase: Day
Players: A (Alive), B (Alive), C (Alive), D (Alive), E (Alive), F (Alive). This list also represents the seating order. The first and last players are seated next to each other.
These roles are in the game: Empath, Imp, Investigator, Poisoner, Ravenkeeper, Slayer, Soldier, Washerwoman. You can use the rules to bluff.
Your role: Empath - Learns how many of their two alive neighbors are evil. Reason about the game state and find the evil players.

You sense that 1 of your alive neighbors are evil.

Game state for player E:
A: number of conversations = 1, private info = Alignment: Good, Role: Washerwoman, Info: Claims to have seen either C or B as Soldier.
B: number of conversations = 0, private info = Alignment: Unknown, Role: Investigator, Info: There's doubt raised on B's claim and they might be bluffing.
C: number of conversations = 1, private info = Alignment: Unknown, Role: Soldier, Info: Mentioned in Washerwoman claim as Soldier.
D: number of conversations = 0, private info = Alignment: Unknown, Role: Empath, Info: Claim contradicts with E's Empath reading.
F: number of conversations = 0, private info = Alignment: Unknown, Role: None, Info: One of E's neighbors might be evil.

First, think about the update the number of conversations, second think about an update for private info about other players.


Based on the conversation history and the private info, reason about role and the alignment for each player and update the private info. Example:Alignment: ,Role:, Info:
 For role write the most plausibel role as one word. Additional infos like possible roles are part of Info. If there is no new information keep the private state as it is. No extra explanation. Do not add the Current Player.
Return the updated Feature State in JSON format with keys for each player and values being an object with 'number of conversations' and 'private info' fields. Do NOT use any markdown formatting (e.g., ```json) in your response and use double quotes.

You are an assistant tasked with updating a player's game state based for Blood on the Clocktower. The player's private feature state contains, for each other player, the number of conversations they've had.

Current Player: E

Recent Conversation History:
E: {'type': 'Message', 'Speaker': 'E', 'Audience': ['A', 'C'], 'Message': "I'm the Empath, and I sensed that 1 of my neighbors, F or A, is evil. This contradicts D's claim of being the Empath and getting a '0' reading. Given that B's claim as Investigator and A's Washerwoman info don't align, I'm more inclined to trust A's information. We should consider the possibility that B might be bluffing."}
E: {'type': 'Message', 'Speaker': 'E', 'Audience': ['D', 'F'], 'Message': "I've claimed to be the Empath and sensed that 1 of my neighbors, F or A, is evil.

We should discuss who among B, D, or F might be the bluffing evil player."}

C: number of conversations = 1, private info = Alignment: Unknown, Role: Soldier, Info: Mentioned in Washerwoman claim as Soldier.
D: number of conversations = 0, private info = Alignment: Unknown, Role: Empath, Info: Claim contradicts with E's Empath reading.
F: number of conversations = 0, private info = Alignment: Unknown, Role: None, Info: One of E's neighbors might be evil.

First, think about the update the number of conversations, second think about an update for private info about other players.


Based on the conversation history and the private info, reason about role and the alignment for each player and update the private info. Example:Alignment: ,Role:, Info:
 For role write the most plausibel role as one word. Additional infos like possible roles are part of Info. If there is no new information keep the private state as it is. No extra explanation. Do not add the Current Player.

Your role: Washerwoman - Learns that one of two players is a specific Townsfolk. Reason about the game state and find the evil players.

You learn that C or B is a Soldier

Game state for player A:
B: number of conversations = 0, private info = Alignment: Unknown, Role: Investigator, Info: Claims to have seen A or E as Poisoner
C: number of conversations = 1, private info = Alignment: Town, Role: Soldier, Info: Possible Soldier based on Washerwoman info
D: number of conversations = 0, private info = Alignment: Town, Role: Empath, Info: Got a '0' reading, suggesting neighbors are not evil
E: number of conversations = 1, private info = Alignment: Unknown, Role: Unknown, Info: No new information
F: number of conversations = 0, private info = Alignment: Unknown, Role: Unknown, Info: No new information

First, think about the update the number of conversations, second think about an update for private info about other players.


Based on the conversation history and the private info, reason about role and the alignment for each player and update the private info. Example:Alignment: ,Role:, Info:
 For role write the most plausibel role as one word. Additional infos like possible roles are part of Info. If there is no new information keep the private state as it is. No extra explanation. Do not add the Current Player.
Return the updated Feature State in JSON format with keys for each player and values being an object with 'number of conversations' and 'private info' fields. Do NOT use any markdown formatting (e.g., ```json) in your response and use double quotes.

B: number of conversations = 2, private info = Alignment: Unknown, Role: Investigator, Info: Claims Investigator, saw A or E as Poisoner
D: number of conversations = 2, private info = Alignment: Unknown, Role: Empath, Info: Claims Empath, got a '0' on neighbors B and E

A: {'type': 'Message', 'Speaker': 'A', 'Audience': ['B', 'E'], 'Message': "B, can you explain more about your Investigator claim? I learned that you or C is a Soldier as the Washerwoman, so this information about A or E as Poisoner is confusing. Also, E, your Empath claim contradicting D's makes the situation even more compelling. We need to uncover if there are outside claims causing Discord. Let's all piece together this strange scenario."}

Players: A (Alive), B (Alive), C (Alive), D (Alive), E (Alive), F (Alive). This list also represents the seating order. The first and last players are seated next to each other.
These roles are in the game: Empath, Imp, Investigator, Poisoner, Ravenkeeper, Slayer, Soldier, Washerwoman. You can use the rules to bluff.
Your role: Washerwoman - Learns that one of two players is a specific Townsfolk. Reason about the game state and find the evil players.

You learn that C or B is a Soldier

Game state for player A:
B: number of conversations = 0, private info = Alignment: Unknown, Role: Investigator, Info: Claims to have seen A or E as Poisoner
C: number of conversations = 1, private info = Alignment: Town, Role: Soldier, Info: Possible Soldier based on Washerwoman info
D: number of conversations = 0, private info = Alignment: Town, Role: Empath, Info: Got a '0' reading, suggesting neighbors are not evil
E: number of conversations = 1, private info = Alignment: Unknown, Role: Unknown, Info: No new information
F: number of conversations = 0, private info = Alignment: Unknown, Role: Unknown, Info: No new information

First, think about the update the number of conversations, second think about an update for private info about other players.


Based on the conversation history and the private info, reason about role and the alignment for each player and update the private info. Example:Alignment: ,Role:, Info:
 For role write the most plausibel role as one word. Additional infos like possible roles are part of Info. If there is no new information keep the private state as it is. No extra explanation. Do not add the Current Player.
Return the updated Feature State in JSON format with keys for each player and values being an object with 'number of conversations' and 'private info' fields. Do NOT use any markdown formatting (e.g., ```json) in your response and use double quotes.

These roles are in the game: Empath, Imp, Investigator, Poisoner, Ravenkeeper, Slayer, Soldier, Washerwoman. You can use the rules to bluff.
Your role: Washerwoman - Learns that one of two players is a specific Townsfolk. Reason about the game state and find the evil players.

You learn that C or B is a Soldier

Game state for player A:
B: number of conversations = 0, private info = Alignment: Unknown, Role: Investigator, Info: Claims to have seen A or E as Poisoner
C: number of conversations = 1, private info = Alignment: Town, Role: Soldier, Info: Possible Soldier based on Washerwoman info
D: number of conversations = 0, private info = Alignment: Town, Role: Empath, Info: Got a '0' reading, suggesting neighbors are not evil
E: number of conversations = 1, private info = Alignment: Unknown, Role: Unknown, Info: No new information
F: number of conversations = 0, private info = Alignment: Unknown, Role: Unknown, Info: No new information

Chronological conversation History:
E: {'type': 'Message', 'Speaker': 'E', 'Audience': ['C', 'A'], 'Message': "I am the Empath, and I got a reading of '1', which means one of my neighbors is evil. This conflicts with D's claim as Empath, which is suspicious. We should consider that D might be lying."}
C: {'type': 'Message', 'Speaker': 'C', 'Audience': ['A', 'B'], 'Message': "I believe A's claim as the Washerwoman can be trusted, and it aligns with my role as the Soldier. This might imply that B's information about A or E being the Poisoner could be true, especially since E is pointing fingers at D, who got a '0' from their Empath ability on neighbors B and E. We need to consider the possibility that E might be the Poisoner trying to sow discord."}
