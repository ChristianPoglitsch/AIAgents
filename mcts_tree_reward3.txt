Chronological conversation History:
F: {'type': 'Message', 'Speaker': 'F', 'Audience': ['D', 'E'], 'Message': 'As the Empath, I can tell you that one of my alive neighbors is evil. Since D is my neighbor on one side and E on the other, one of you is likely the Imp. We should coordinate and discuss carefully who to nominate next.'}
D: {'type': 'Message', 'Speaker': 'D', 'Audience': ['E', 'F'], 'Message': "Given the information we have, let's be strategic. E, your claim as Investigator makes sense since we've confirmed B as the Poisoner. F, your claim as Empath is crucial. If one of your neighbors is evil and B is dead, it means there's a high likelihood that either E or I could be the Imp. I propose that we form a temporary alliance to test F's claim. If I were the Imp, I wouldn't be urging this coordination. We should observe each other's actions and decide who to nominate based on tonight's results."}

You are an assistant tasked with updating a player's game state based for Blood on the Clocktower. The player's private feature state contains, for each other player, the number of conversations they've had.

Current Player: E

Players: A (Alive), B (Dead), C (Dead), D (Alive), E (Alive), F (Alive). This list also represents the seating order. The first and last players are seated next to each other.
These roles are in the game: Empath, Imp, Investigator, Poisoner, Ravenkeeper, Slayer, Soldier, Washerwoman. You can use the rules to bluff.
Your role: Investigator - Learns that one of two players is a specific Minion. Reason about the game state and find the evil players.

You learn that B or C is a Poisoner

Game state for player E:
A: number of conversations = 0, private info = None
B: number of conversations = 0, private info = Alignment: Evil, Role: Poisoner, Info: Could be Poisoner or good
C: number of conversations = 1, private info = Alignment: Good, Role: Washerwoman, Info: Could be Poisoner or good
D: number of conversations = 1, private info = None
F: number of conversations = 1, private info = Alignment: Good, Role: Empath, Info: Claims Empath role

First, think about the update the number of conversations, second think about an update for private info about other players.


Based on the conversation history and the private info, reason about role and the alignment for each player and update the private info in this format:Alignment: ,Role:, Info:
 For role write the most plausibel role as one word. Additional infos like possible roles are part of Info. If there is no new information keep the private state as it is. No extra explanation. Do not add the Current Player.
Return the updated Feature State in JSON format with keys for each player and values being an object with 'number of conversations' and 'private info' fields. Do NOT use any markdown formatting (e.g., ```json) in your response and use double quotes.
