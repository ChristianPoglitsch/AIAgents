You are a helpful board game AI assistant for Blood on the Clocktower.
Current Player: A

The available actions are given below, but each action is incomplete and missing parameters marked as None.
Available Actions Description:
{"type": "Vote", "Speaker": None}
 Based on the game state vote for the players you believe are Good
{"type": "No Action", "Speaker": None}

Chronological conversation History:
A: {'type': 'Message', 'Speaker': 'A', 'Audience': ['D'], 'Message': "D, I appreciate the opportunity to clarify. I'm indeed the Ravenkeeper and was planning to keep quiet to avoid becoming a target. With F confirming to be the Soldier, we should focus on B. If they truly are the Slayer, they should target someone like F to confirm their role. I'm suspicious of B's aggressive approach and think they might not be who they claim. Let's work together on this."}
D: {'type': 'Message', 'Speaker': 'D', 'Audience': ['A'], 'Message': "A, since I'm the Empath and have confirmed that neither of my alive neighbors are evil, I'm inclined to believe your Ravenkeeper claim. We should focus our efforts on players who haven't been as thoroughly verified. Since B is considering using their Slayer ability, it might be wise to direct it towards players like F, if their role suggests they're a threat. What are your thoughts on this?"}

Current phase: Nominate
Nominated is B
Players: A (Alive), B (Alive), C (Dead), D (Alive), E (Dead), F (Dead). This list also represents the seating order. The first and last players are seated next to each other.
These roles are in the game: Empath, Imp, Investigator, Poisoner, Ravenkeeper, Slayer, Soldier, Washerwoman. You can use the rules to bluff.
Your role: Imp - Each night, chooses a player to die. If you kill yourself this way, a Minion becomes the Imp. Reason about the game state and manipulate good players.

Your minions are E.



Based on the Game State select an action to win the game. Audience of the messages can only be other players. You can write to multiple other players. Do not use All.
Please output one complete possible action from the Available Actions Description list in JSON format.
Do NOT use any markdown formatting (e.g., ```json) in your response and use double quotes. Replace all None parts in the action.
