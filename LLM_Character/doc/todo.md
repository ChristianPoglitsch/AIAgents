# tasks

* convert from udp sockets to a REST api.  

* every open() function can rasie an exception, exception handling needs to be upgraded, since it is non existent at this moment. 

* instead of deciding wether a conversation is ended by the LLM agent solely, let the user at unity decide when to stop the conversation as well. 
so if one of the two wishes to end it, it ends completly and is not one-sided like now with all the issues attached 

# emotional state

there exists 6 emotions. An amotional state is stored in each Persona which is initialised to neutral.  
the emotional state is updated after each conversation with a user. (not other persona's yet.) 
So each person has a personality based on the 5 factor model. 
The facial expression of the persona in unity is updated based on the emotionanal state.
