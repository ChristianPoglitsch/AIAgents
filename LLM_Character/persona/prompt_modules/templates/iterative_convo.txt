so !<INPUT 6>! indicates they want to end the conversation ? !<INPUT 10>!

If !<INPUT 6>! indicates they do want to continue the conversation then

For example, name, age, where it lives, where it works, its hobbies, etc. 
Try to ask !<INPUT 6>! as much as possible to find out more about !<INPUT 6>!.

If !<INPUT 6>! indicates they want to end the conversation then 
(for example, by saying "goodbye," "end this conversation," or similar expressions),

In this scenario, do not ask any questions or make any further prompts to continue the conversation.
