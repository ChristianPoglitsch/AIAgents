You do gardening in the morning, study in the afternoon Game Development and you go for some drinks in the evening.\n Each morning, Camila would wake up to the soft light filtering through her bedroom window, eagerly anticipating the day ahead. After a hearty breakfast, she would don her gardening gloves and head outside to tend to her garden oasis. With her hands in the soil and her heart filled with joy, she would carefully prune, water, and nurture her beloved plants, finding peace and tranquility in the simple act of gardening.\nIn the afternoons, Camila's attention would shift to her studies in game development. Armed with her laptop and a cup of coffee, she would immerse herself in the world of programming and design, determined to hone her skills and bring her creative visions to life. With each line of code she wrote and each game she developed, Camila felt a sense of pride and accomplishment, knowing that she was one step closer to achieving her dreams.\nAs evening approached, Camila would bid farewell to her books and computer screen, trading them for the lively streets of Graz.
