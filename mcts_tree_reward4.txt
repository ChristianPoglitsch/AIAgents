You are an assistant tasked with updating a player's game state based for Blood on the Clocktower. The player's private feature state contains, for each other player, the number of conversations they've had.

Current Player: D

Recent Conversation History:
E: {'type': 'Message', 'Speaker': 'E', 'Audience': ['D', 'F'], 'Message': 'Given that one of my neighbors is evil, and B is confirmed as the Ravenkeeper by C, I suspect F might not be the Investigator as claimed. D, since you might also be the Ravenkeeper, let us discuss our next steps to figure out the truth and identify the Imp. F, if you have any additional information regarding A being the Poisoner, please share it.'}
D: {'type': 'Message', 'Speaker': 'D', 'Audience': ['E', 'F'], 'Message': "I'm not the Ravenkeeper, but I am a good role trying to work with everyone here. Based on what E said, if F is indeed the Investigator, we need to be cautious because there's a chance they could be the Imp. Let's work together to gather more information about everyone's roles."}

Current phase: Day
Players: A (Dead), B (Alive), C (Dead), D (Alive), E (Alive), F (Alive). This list also represents the seating order. The first and last players are seated next to each other.
These roles are in the game: Empath, Imp, Investigator, Poisoner, Ravenkeeper, Slayer, Soldier, Washerwoman. You can use the rules to bluff.
Your role: Imp - Each night, chooses a player to die. If you kill yourself this way, a Minion becomes the Imp. Reason about the game state and manipulate good players.

Your minions are A.

Game state for player D:
A: number of conversations = 1, private info = Alignment: Evil, Role: Poisoner, Info: Minion and possibly misleading others
B: number of conversations = 1, private info = Alignment: Good, Role: Ravenkeeper, Info: Possibly confirmed by Washerwoman
C: number of conversations = 0, private info = Alignment: Good, Role: Washerwoman, Info: Claimed Washerwoman and gave information about Ravenkeeper
E: number of conversations = 2, private info = Alignment: Unknown, Role: Unknown, Info: None
F: number of conversations = 0, private info = Alignment: Unknown, Role: Investigator, Info: Rumored to be spreading uncertainty

First, think about the update the number of conversations, second think about an update for private info about other players.


Based on the conversation history and the private info, reason about role and the alignment for each player and update the private info in this format:Alignment: ,Role:, Info:
 For role write the most plausibel role as one word. Additional infos like possible roles are part of Info. If there is no new information keep the private state as it is. No extra explanation. Do not add the Current Player.
Return the updated Feature State in JSON format with keys for each player and values being an object with 'number of conversations' and 'private info' fields. Do NOT use any markdown formatting (e.g., ```json) in your response and use double quotes.

F: {'type': 'Message', 'Speaker': 'F', 'Audience': ['B', 'E'], 'Message': "Hey B and E, I think it's important to share that as the Investigator, I learned that one of A or C is the Poisoner. Since A is dead, it's likely C was the Poisoner. This might mean B's claim as the Ravenkeeper is true unless they were somehow misled. E, since you're the Empath, has there been any change in your readings? This could help us identify if there's another evil player among us."}
D: {'type': 'Message', 'Speaker': 'D', 'Audience': ['B', 'F'], 'Message': "Hey B and F, I've been thinking about what E said. Since C confirmed one of us is the Ravenkeeper, and you've claimed it, B, I believe you. But we should be cautious as there could be misinformation. F, do you have any thoughts on this? It might help us figure out who the evil player is."}
