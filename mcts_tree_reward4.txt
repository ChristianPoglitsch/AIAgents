Current phase: Day
Players: A (Alive), B (Alive), C (Alive), D (Alive), E (Alive), F (Alive). This list also represents the seating order. The first and last players are seated next to each other.
These roles are in the game: Empath, Imp, Investigator, Poisoner, Ravenkeeper, Slayer, Soldier, Washerwoman. You can use the rules to bluff.
Your role: Imp - Each night, chooses a player to die. If you kill yourself this way, a Minion becomes the Imp. Reason about the game state and manipulate good players.



Game state for player E:
A: number of conversations = 0, private info = Alignment: Unknown, Role: Unknown, Info: No new information.
B: number of conversations = 1, private info = Alignment: Good, Role: Soldier, Info: Engaged in a private conversation with E. Possible roles: Empath, Investigator, Washerwoman.

D: number of conversations = 0, private info = Alignment: Unknown, Role: Unknown, Info: No new information.
F: number of conversations = 0, private info = Alignment: Unknown, Role: Unknown, Info: No new information.

First, think about the update the number of conversations, second think about an update for private info about other players.


Based on the conversation history and the private info, reason about role and the alignment for each player and update the private info. Example:Alignment: ,Role:, Info:
 For role write the most plausibel role as one word. Additional infos like possible roles are part of Info. If there is no new information keep the private state as it is. No extra explanation. Do not add the Current Player.
Return the updated Feature State in JSON format with keys for each player and values being an object with 'number of conversations' and 'private info' fields. Do NOT use any markdown formatting (e.g., ```json) in your response and use double quotes.
