Based on the conversation history and the private info, reason about role and the alignment for each player and update the private info. Example:Alignment: ,Role:, Info:
 For role write the most plausibel role as one word. Additional infos like possible roles are part of Info. If there is no new information keep the private state as it is. No extra explanation. Do not add the Current Player.

B: number of conversations = 0, private info = None
C: number of conversations = 0, private info = None
D: number of conversations = 0, private info = None
E: number of conversations = 0, private info = None

Current phase: Day
Players: A (Alive), B (Alive), C (Alive), D (Dead), E (Alive), F (Alive). This list also represents the seating order. The first and last players are seated next to each other.
These roles are in the game: Empath, Imp, Investigator, Poisoner, Ravenkeeper, Slayer, Soldier, Washerwoman. You can use the rules to bluff.
Your role: Slayer - Once per game, publicly chooses a player. If that player is the Demon, they die. Reason about the game state and find the evil players.



Game state for player E:
A: number of conversations = 0, private info = None
B: number of conversations = 0, private info = None
C: number of conversations = 0, private info = None
D: number of conversations = 0, private info = None
F: number of conversations = 0, private info = None

First, think about the update the number of conversations, second think about an update for private info about other players.


Based on the conversation history and the private info, reason about role and the alignment for each player and update the private info. Example:Alignment: ,Role:, Info:
 For role write the most plausibel role as one word. Additional infos like possible roles are part of Info. If there is no new information keep the private state as it is. No extra explanation. Do not add the Current Player.
Return the updated Feature State in JSON format with keys for each player and values being an object with 'number of conversations' and 'private info' fields. Do NOT use any markdown formatting (e.g., ```json) in your response and use double quotes.

Players: A (Dead), B (Alive), C (Alive), D (Dead), E (Alive), F (Alive). This list also represents the seating order. The first and last players are seated next to each other.
These roles are in the game: Empath, Imp, Investigator, Poisoner, Ravenkeeper, Slayer, Soldier, Washerwoman. You can use the rules to bluff.
Your role: Washerwoman - Learns that one of two players is a specific Townsfolk. Reason about the game state and find the evil players.

You learn that D or F is a Empath

Game state for player F:
A: number of conversations = 0, private info = Alignment: Unknown, Role: Unknown, Info: No interactions yet.
B: number of conversations = 1, private info = Alignment: Good, Role: Empath, Info: Claims to be Empath with a reading of 0, trusting neighbors.
C: number of conversations = 1, private info = Alignment: Unknown, Role: Unknown, Info: Seems to strategize with F, possible fellow Townsfolk or bluffing.
D: number of conversations = 0, private info = Alignment: Good, Role: Empath, Info: Either D or F is the Empath, possible bluffing by D but seems to push suspicion on F.
E: number of conversations = 0, private info = Alignment: Unknown, Role: Unknown, Info: No interactions yet.

First, think about the update the number of conversations, second think about an update for private info about other players.


Based on the conversation history and the private info, reason about role and the alignment for each player and update the private info. Example:Alignment: ,Role:, Info:
 For role write the most plausibel role as one word. Additional infos like possible roles are part of Info. If there is no new information keep the private state as it is. No extra explanation. Do not add the Current Player.
Return the updated Feature State in JSON format with keys for each player and values being an object with 'number of conversations' and 'private info' fields. Do NOT use any markdown formatting (e.g., ```json) in your response and use double quotes.

You are an assistant tasked with updating a player's game state based for Blood on the Clocktower. The player's private feature state contains, for each other player, the number of conversations they've had.

Current Player: F

Recent Conversation History:

Players: A (Dead), B (Alive), C (Alive), D (Dead), E (Alive), F (Dead). This list also represents the seating order. The first and last players are seated next to each other.
These roles are in the game: Empath, Imp, Investigator, Poisoner, Ravenkeeper, Slayer, Soldier, Washerwoman. You can use the rules to bluff.
Your role: Washerwoman - Learns that one of two players is a specific Townsfolk. Reason about the game state and find the evil players.

You learn that D or F is a Empath

Game state for player F:
A: number of conversations = 2, private info = Alignment: Unknown, Role: Investigator, Info: Shares info with E and F, could help identify Poisoner.
B: number of conversations = 3, private info = Alignment: Good, Role: Empath, Info: Claims to be Empath with a reading of 0, trusting neighbors.
C: number of conversations = 1, private info = Alignment: Unknown, Role: Soldier, Info: Claims to be Soldier, suspects D is bluffing, possible bluffing.
D: number of conversations = 0, private info = Alignment: Evil, Role: Poisoner, Info: Either D or F is the Empath, suspicion arises from A's info and possible bluff.
E: number of conversations = 2, private info = Alignment: Unknown, Role: Unknown, Info: Discusses with A and F, no other interactions yet.

First, think about the update the number of conversations, second think about an update for private info about other players.


Based on the conversation history and the private info, reason about role and the alignment for each player and update the private info. Example:Alignment: ,Role:, Info:
 For role write the most plausibel role as one word. Additional infos like possible roles are part of Info. If there is no new information keep the private state as it is. No extra explanation. Do not add the Current Player.
Return the updated Feature State in JSON format with keys for each player and values being an object with 'number of conversations' and 'private info' fields. Do NOT use any markdown formatting (e.g., ```json) in your response and use double quotes.

Game State:
Current phase: Day
Players: A (Alive), B (Alive), C (Alive), D (Alive), E (Alive), F (Alive). This list also represents the seating order. The first and last players are seated next to each other.
These roles are in the game: Empath, Imp, Investigator, Poisoner, Ravenkeeper, Slayer, Soldier, Washerwoman. You can use the rules to bluff.
Your role: Imp - Each night, chooses a player to die. If you kill yourself this way, a Minion becomes the Imp. Reason about the game state and manipulate good players.



Game state for player B:
A: number of conversations = 1, private info = Alignment: Good, Role: Empath, Info: Claims to have sensed 1 evil neighbor
C: number of conversations = 0, private info = None
D: number of conversations = 0, private info = None
E: number of conversations = 0, private info = None
F: number of conversations = 1, private info = Alignment: Unknown, Role: Soldier, Info: Claims to be the Soldier

Chronological conversation History:
C: {'type': 'Message', 'Speaker': 'C', 'Audience': ['B'], 'Message': "Hey B, I think we can work together to slip some misinformation past the others. Maybe you can claim a role that's suspicious but not too crucial."}
D: {'type': 'Message', 'Speaker': 'D', 'Audience': ['A', 'B', 'F'], 'Message': "I just want to share that I'm the Investigator, and I've learned that either C or I am the Poisoner. This means there's a good chance C is evil. Let's keep an eye on them."}

First, consider a possible answer. Then, provide the corresponding action. Audience of the messages can only be other players. You can write to multiple other players. Do not use All.
Please output one complete possible action from the Available Actions Description list in JSON format.
Do NOT use any markdown formatting (e.g., ```json) in your response and use double quotes. Replace all None parts in the action.

You are an assistant tasked with updating a player's game state based for Blood on the Clocktower. The player's private feature state contains, for each other player, the number of conversations they've had.

Current Player: A

Game state for player A:
B: number of conversations = 2, private info = {'Alignment': 'Evil', 'Role': 'Poisoner', 'Info': 'Could be one of B or F based on Empath info and their behavior. C suspects B might be spreading misinformation.'}

F: number of conversations = 2, private info = {'Alignment': 'Evil', 'Role': 'Imp', 'Info': 'Could be one of B or F based on Empath info and their behavior.'}

First, think about the update the number of conversations, second think about an update for private info about other players.


Based on the conversation history and the private info, reason about role and the alignment for each player and update the private info. Example:Alignment: ,Role:, Info:
 For role write the most plausibel role as one word. Additional infos like possible roles are part of Info. If there is no new information keep the private state as it is. No extra explanation. Do not add the Current Player.
Return the updated Feature State in JSON format with keys for each player and values being an object with 'number of conversations' and 'private info' fields. Do NOT use any markdown formatting (e.g., ```json) in your response and use double quotes.
