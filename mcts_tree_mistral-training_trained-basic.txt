Current Player: F

Recent Conversation History:
C: {'type': 'Message', 'Speaker': 'C', 'Audience': ['A', 'B', 'D', 'E', 'F'], 'Message': "Hello everyone, I'm the Slayer. I'm considering using my ability today. Has anyone heard or noticed anything suspicious about any player?"}
F: {'type': 'Message', 'Speaker': 'F', 'Audience': ['C'], 'Message': "I haven't noticed anything suspicious yet, but it would be good to get more information before making a decision. Do you have any leads or suspicions we can discuss?"}

Current phase: Day
Players: A (Alive), B (Alive), C (Alive), D (Alive), E (Alive), F (Alive). This list also represents the seating order. The first and last players are seated next to each other.
These roles are in the game: Empath, Imp, Investigator, Poisoner, Ravenkeeper, Slayer, Soldier, Washerwoman. You can use the rules to bluff.
Your role: Poisoner - Each night, poison one player. Reason about the game state and manipulate good players.

The Demon is A.

Game state for player F:
A: number of conversations = 0, private info = None
B: number of conversations = 0, private info = None
C: number of conversations = 0, private info = None
D: number of conversations = 0, private info = None
E: number of conversations = 0, private info = None

First, think about the update the number of conversations, second think about an update for private info about other players.


Based on the conversation history and the private info, reason about role and the alignment for each player and update the private info. Example:Alignment: ,Role:, Info:
 For role write the most plausibel role as one word. Additional infos like possible roles are part of Info. If there is no new information keep the private state as it is. No extra explanation. Do not add the Current Player.
Return the updated Feature State in JSON format with keys for each player and values being an object with 'number of conversations' and 'private info' fields. Do NOT use any markdown formatting (e.g., ```json) in your response and use double quotes.

C: {'type': 'Message', 'Speaker': 'C', 'Audience': ['D'], 'Message': "Hey D, I wanted to check in about B's Empath claim. I'm not entirely convinced about it. B said that neither of their neighbors, A or C, are evil, but I have my doubts. Could it be that B is bluffing or misinformed? I'd love to hear what you think."}

Current phase: Day
Players: A (Alive), B (Alive), C (Alive), D (Alive), E (Alive), F (Alive). This list also represents the seating order. The first and last players are seated next to each other.
These roles are in the game: Empath, Imp, Investigator, Poisoner, Ravenkeeper, Slayer, Soldier, Washerwoman. You can use the rules to bluff.
Your role: Slayer - Once per game, publicly chooses a player. If that player is the Demon, they die. Reason about the game state and find the evil players.



Game state for player C:
A: number of conversations = 0, private info = None
B: number of conversations = 1, private info = Alignment: Unknown, Role: Unknown, Info: Discussed suspicions about neighbors
D: number of conversations = 0, private info = None
E: number of conversations = 0, private info = None
F: number of conversations = 0, private info = None

First, think about the update the number of conversations, second think about an update for private info about other players.


Based on the conversation history and the private info, reason about role and the alignment for each player and update the private info. Example:Alignment: ,Role:, Info:
 For role write the most plausibel role as one word. Additional infos like possible roles are part of Info. If there is no new information keep the private state as it is. No extra explanation. Do not add the Current Player.
Return the updated Feature State in JSON format with keys for each player and values being an object with 'number of conversations' and 'private info' fields. Do NOT use any markdown formatting (e.g., ```json) in your response and use double quotes.

First, think about the update the number of conversations, second think about an update for private info about other players.


Based on the conversation history and the private info, reason about role and the alignment for each player and update the private info. Example:Alignment: ,Role:, Info:
 For role write the most plausibel role as one word. Additional infos like possible roles are part of Info. If there is no new information keep the private state as it is. No extra explanation. Do not add the Current Player.
Return the updated Feature State in JSON format with keys for each player and values being an object with 'number of conversations' and 'private info' fields. Do NOT use any markdown formatting (e.g., ```json) in your response and use double quotes.

You are an assistant tasked with updating a player's game state based for Blood on the Clocktower. The player's private feature state contains, for each other player, the number of conversations they've had.

Current Player: C

Recent Conversation History:
B: {'type': 'Message', 'Speaker': 'B', 'Audience': 'C', 'Message': "Hey C, I'm the Empath. I got a reading of 0, so I trust my neighbors. Who do you think might be suspicious?"}
C: {'type': 'Message', 'Speaker': 'C', 'Audience': 'B', 'Message': "I'm the Slayer, so I'm definitely suspicious. Just kidding, I'm actually trying to figure out who the real threats are. Have you heard anything about D or E?"}

Current phase: Day
Players: A (Alive), B (Alive), C (Alive), D (Alive), E (Alive), F (Alive). This list also represents the seating order. The first and last players are seated next to each other.
These roles are in the game: Empath, Imp, Investigator, Poisoner, Ravenkeeper, Slayer, Soldier, Washerwoman. You can use the rules to bluff.
Your role: Slayer - Once per game, publicly chooses a player. If that player is the Demon, they die. Reason about the game state and find the evil players.

You are an assistant tasked with updating a player's game state based for Blood on the Clocktower. The player's private feature state contains, for each other player, the number of conversations they've had.

Current Player: F

Recent Conversation History:
E: {'type': 'Message', 'Speaker': 'E', 'Audience': ['B', 'F'], 'Message': "Hey B and F, do you have any suspicions or insights about who might be evil? I'm trying to piece together any information we have to identify the threats."}
F: {'type': 'Message', 'Speaker': 'F', 'Audience': ['E'], 'Message': "I have a theory that C might be the Imp. They've been very quiet this game, which makes me suspicious. What do you think?"}

Current phase: Day
Players: A (Alive), B (Alive), C (Alive), D (Alive), E (Alive), F (Alive). This list also represents the seating order. The first and last players are seated next to each other.
These roles are in the game: Empath, Imp, Investigator, Poisoner, Ravenkeeper, Slayer, Soldier, Washerwoman. You can use the rules to bluff.
Your role: Poisoner - Each night, poison one player. Reason about the game state and manipulate good players.

B: number of conversations = 0, private info = None
C: number of conversations = 0, private info = None
D: number of conversations = 0, private info = None
E: number of conversations = 0, private info = None

First, think about the update the number of conversations, second think about an update for private info about other players.


Based on the conversation history and the private info, reason about role and the alignment for each player and update the private info. Example:Alignment: ,Role:, Info:
 For role write the most plausibel role as one word. Additional infos like possible roles are part of Info. If there is no new information keep the private state as it is. No extra explanation. Do not add the Current Player.
Return the updated Feature State in JSON format with keys for each player and values being an object with 'number of conversations' and 'private info' fields. Do NOT use any markdown formatting (e.g., ```json) in your response and use double quotes.

You are an assistant tasked with updating a player's game state based for Blood on the Clocktower. The player's private feature state contains, for each other player, the number of conversations they've had.

Current Player: F

Recent Conversation History:
D: {'type': 'Message', 'Speaker': 'D', 'Audience': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'E', 'F'], 'Message': "I am the Ravenkeeper. If I am killed at night, I will gain the ability to learn the role of one player. Let's work together to find the evil players."}
F: {'type': 'Message', 'Speaker': 'F', 'Audience': ['A'], 'Message': "Hey A, I think we should stick to our roles and try to keep a low profile. If anyone asks, I can claim to be the Soldier. Let's just be careful and watch our backs."}

Current phase: Day
Players: A (Alive), B (Alive), C (Alive), D (Alive), E (Alive), F (Alive). This list also represents the seating order. The first and last players are seated next to each other.
These roles are in the game: Empath, Imp, Investigator, Poisoner, Ravenkeeper, Slayer, Soldier, Washerwoman. You can use the rules to bluff.
Your role: Poisoner - Each night, poison one player. Reason about the game state and manipulate good players.

The Demon is A.

Game state for player F:
A: number of conversations = 0, private info = None
B: number of conversations = 0, private info = None
C: number of conversations = 0, private info = None
D: number of conversations = 0, private info = None
E: number of conversations = 0, private info = None

First, think about the update the number of conversations, second think about an update for private info about other players.


Based on the conversation history and the private info, reason about role and the alignment for each player and update the private info. Example:Alignment: ,Role:, Info:
 For role write the most plausibel role as one word. Additional infos like possible roles are part of Info. If there is no new information keep the private state as it is. No extra explanation. Do not add the Current Player.
Return the updated Feature State in JSON format with keys for each player and values being an object with 'number of conversations' and 'private info' fields. Do NOT use any markdown formatting (e.g., ```json) in your response and use double quotes.
